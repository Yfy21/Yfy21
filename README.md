<h1> :wave: Hello there! I'm Andre.</h1>

<h3>  Welcome to my GitHub profile! </h3>

Iâ€™m a sociologist turned data analyst focused on helping people make the best possible decisions for their organizations and, ideally, for society as a whole.
<br>
<br>
My academic background in the social sciences gave me a strong foundation in philosophy, politics, society, and human behavior, but I've realized it lacked the quantitative tools needed to fully understand and act on complex issues. Believing that reliable, well-organized information is essential for cooperation, problem-solving, and impactful action â€” all key to social progress â€” I decided to complement my qualitative expertise with strong quantitative skills by studying data analytics and data science.
<br>
<br>
Three years later, here I am.

<h4>What I Do:</h4>

- Automate data pipelines (ETL/ELT) to ensure clean, accurate, and ready-to-use datasets.
- Build clear, interactive dashboards and visualizations in Power BI, Excel, and Python.
- Extract insights using SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), and statistical methods.
- Translate complex analyses into actionable recommendations for non-technical audiences.

<h4>What You'll Find:</h4>

Projects ranging from automation scripts and data cleaning workflows to interactive dashboards and statistical analyses â€” all reflecting my commitment to clarity, organization, and real-world applicability.
