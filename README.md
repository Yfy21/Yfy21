<h4 align="center"> Hello there! :wave: </h4>

<h4 align="center"> I'm Andre. Welcome to my GitHub profile! </h4>

<br>

I'm a sociology master's student at the [University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP)](https://www5.usp.br/) and a data enthusiast determined to promote a data-driven culture within organizations and society at large. I am thoroughly motivated to help people make the best decisions they can, which is only possible with adequate, actionable information. Therefore, believing in efficiency, organization, and in people's capacity to make good decisions when properly informed, my goal is to help streamline processes that ensure that stakeholders are provided with the most relevant data when confronted with the necessity to take action.
