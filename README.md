<h3 align="center"> Hello there! :wave: </h3>

<h3 align="center"> I'm Andre. Welcome to my GitHub profile! </h3>

<br>

I'm a sociology master's student at the [University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP)](https://www5.usp.br/), fascinated by the interactions between biology, psychology and sociology in explaining human behavior. In fact, I am currently working on an holistic approach to make sense of how we become humans.

Seldom have I remained in the confines of disciplines and, in one of my many excursions outside of sociology, I have grown fond of data science. On the long run, my goal is to combine my knowledge of the human being with AI systems' building. But there is still a long way to go, so any opportunity to learn is welcome!
